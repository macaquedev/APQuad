An Arduino Quadruped designed to be as straightforward as possible to use and make.

I have posted all code, all STL's and all building instructions on this Github repository.

Please share this repository if you have found this helpful.

Please post a comment or email me at macaquedev@gmail.com if you need help or feel something is wrong.

DISCLAIMER - I hold no responsibility for any damage caused. This is a project that has gone through hours of rigorous testing, which means there is very little risk of something being wrong in the project, but it is very easy to connect something incorrectly. Please double check ALL electronics before switching on your APQuad for the first time.

To start, please clone this repository and then choose a servo out of the ones I have mentioned above. Then please go into the folder with the same name as the servo you are using for your APQuad and read the relevant README files.
